A full-capture Hierarchical Bayesian model of Pollock's Closed Robust Design and application to dolphins

This contains a tutorial of several Robust Design Bayesian Mark-Recapture models as presented in the paper Rankin RW, Nicholson K, Allen SL, Krützen M, Bejder L, Pollock KH. 2016 "A full-capture Hierarchical Bayesian model of Pollock's Closed Robust Design and application to dolphins" Frontiers of Marine Science, in Press. This demonstration also uses data directly from the sister publication: "Nicholson K, Bejder L, Allen SL, Krützen M, and Pollock KH. 2012. Abundance, survival and temporary emigration of bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops sp.) off Useless Loop in the western gulf of Shark Bay, Western Australia. Marine and Freshwater Research 63:1059–1068." See BIBTEX citations at the end of this read me.
